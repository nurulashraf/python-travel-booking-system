# SkyHigh Adventures Booking System

## Overview
This is a Python-based booking system for SkyHigh Adventures, a travel agency offering packages to popular destinations. The system allows users to manage bookings for multiple families, calculate costs based on various factors, and display a summary of all bookings. These solutions are part of a university assignment focused on applying fundamental programming concepts.

## Features
- Object-Oriented Design
- Destination Management
- Family Booking Handling
- Dynamic Cost Calculations
- Booking Summary Display

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-travel-booking-system.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```
